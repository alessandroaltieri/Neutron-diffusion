# Neutron diffusion equation
The aim of this project is to solve the neutron diffusion equation at critical conditions, i.e. when total density of neutrons increases exponentially resulting in a runaway process. This is done in a variety of different scenarios:
*   1-D case in cartesian coordinates with Dirichlet BC
*   2-D case in cartesian coordinates with Dirichlet BC
*   3-D case in cartesian coordinates with Dirichlet BC
*   3-D case in cylindrical coordinates with Dirichlet BC
*   3-D case in spherical coordinates with Dirichlet BC
*   3-D case in spherical coordinates with Neumann BC

For all these cases the neutron diffusion is plotted and the associated coefficients are computed and printed out. For the latter, other quantitites are also computed since they need numerical evaluation: the critical radius and volume, the separation constant $\alpha$, the parameter $k$ and the amplitude $A$.
